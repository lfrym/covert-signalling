# covert-signalling

This repository contains a several scripts used for a research project on covert signalling.

sampling_tweets.ipynb: a notebook used to assign a list of tweets across survey participants uniformly
sampling_tweets.py: the above notebook refactored as a function for use in other scripts
simulate_survey.ipynb: a simulated implementation of the surve used to estimate whether overlapping tweet assignment (due to survey software limitations) will be problematic in practice
